He is very professional, very meticulous, very gentle with the clippers ( I have sensitive skin), and takes direction well. The shop is black-owned and gives a classic barbershop vibe that just feels right. I highly recommend this place and Jabari if you are ever in the bay area.\n",

      "I'm not one to give reviews but this was an experience to remember. I got an appointment for a beard groom for the same day as I had some spare time and my usual barber was not available.Before sitting down in the chair I explicitly told the barber that I wanted to shorten the length, keep the v shape and fade it. When he started using the razor I warned him that I had some sensitive skin so probably should be careful with it. After five minutes he tells me that he is \"done\" after basically outlining a bit, cutting me with the razor a couple of times and leaving the same length. I complained that wasn't what I asked him for and he tells me that I was paying for a groom (that included a trim) and I was asking for a styling (that was going to be 50% more), a service they didn't even have in their page. After telling him \"then let's just stop here\" he insisted he would do it without charging more \"as you didn't know\". After talking for a while I ended up staying, putting up with more cuts with the razor until the result was o-kay (while he kept repeating he was the best barber in the whole shop and no one could do what he did (I want to think few barbers can leave these scars, Sweeney Todd impersonator)). I tried to pay with card but oh, surprise they didn't take cards, only apple pay. At that point I just wanted out so offered to pay in cash, when I told him \"so how much after all this?\" Seeing me counting bills he just said \"just give me what you have\". So, yeah, gentlemen, if you want to feel practically mugged with some scars to remember (physical and emotional), this is your barbershop. For everyone else, you can do better and cheaper.\n",

      "\n",
      "Man the vibes was great! Loved the music. I went in yesterday just for a cut because my barber was out of town. I was a walk in and a Italian dude cut my hair and messed it all up my hair line got pushed backed for no reason the cut sucked. The guy was cool but my haircut was bogus for the price he charged I could've went to peoples barber and could of got a nice blend but I will never spend my money on a person who don't got passion for hair !\n",
